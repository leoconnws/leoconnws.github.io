      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
            How do we connect the next billion users to the Internet? How do we capture high-resolution pictures of the Earth, or enable massive-scale IoT across industries? How do we bring compute closer to users? Over the past decade, significant reductions in satellite production and launch costs have opened up a new `space’ – access to Low-Earth Orbits or LEO. Massive constellations consisting of hundreds to tens of thousands of low-flying satellites are being rolled out to beam Internet from space, offer unprecedented resolution imagery services, support globally distributed IoT, provide 5G backhaul, and bring edge even closer to users. The research community needs the right tools to explore various unforeseen opportunities (like global coverage, low-latency connectivity, and high-resolution imagery) and challenges (like extreme mobility, bottlenecked downlinks, and sparse ground infrastructure) that come with LEO deployments.
            <br/><br/>
            Reflecting on community feedback and the interest that the past LEOCONN events (linked above) have managed to generate, we believe this is the right time to bring the LEO community closer together to explore synergies and collaborate, across industry and academia. Toward this, we are hosting a LEOCONN webinar series (WS). We will have one webinar session every ~2 months, and host 2 notable speakers per session who would give deep technical talks on LEO networks and applications.
            <br/><br/>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Measuring the Satellite Links of LEO Networks</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks have become very
popular in recent years, exemplified by Starlink, OneWeb, Kuiper and
Telesat, due to the dramatically reduced
launch cost and increased demand for connectivity anytime, anywhere.
After an exploration of Starlink access, core and backbone networks,
in this talk we focus on the satellite access
network (SAN) of Starlink around the world. In particular, we measure
the access performance in terms of one-way delay and round-trip time
from user terminal (UT) to ground station (GS) and point-of-presence
(PoP), both inside-out and outside-in, and even on inactive dishes. It
reveals the unique characteristics of Starlink SAN in terms of
satellite-GS scheduling, media access control and user contention, and
sheds light on the challenges and opportunities for network protocols
and applications. We will also compare two leading SAN networks, i.e.,
Starlink and OneWeb, according to their targeted customer bases and
corresponding network design architecture and performance, as well as
highlighting a few emerging testbeds.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Using Earth Observation Technologies to Support Sustainable Development in Developing Countries</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Earth Observation (EO) technologies, such as satellites and remote sensing, provide a comprehensive view of the Earth's surface, enabling real-time monitoring and data acquisition. Within the environmental domain, EO facilitates tracking land use changes, deforestation, and biodiversity, thereby supporting evidence-based conservation efforts. Social factors, encompassing population dynamics and urbanization trends, can be analyzed to inform inclusive and resilient development strategies. EO also assumes a crucial role in policy formulation by furnishing accurate and up-to-date information on environmental conditions, thereby supporting informed decision-making. Furthermore, technical aspects, like infrastructure development and resource management, benefit from EO's ability to provide detailed insights into terrain characteristics and natural resource distribution. The integration of Earth Observation across these domains yields a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between environmental, social, policy, and technical factors, fostering a more sustainable and informed approach to development initiatives. In this presentation, I will discuss our lab's work on how we are using satellite earth observation technologies to support sustainable development in developing countries.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Understanding the Performance of LEO Satellite Networks: Insights from Starlink End-User Measurements</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) has been advocated as pivotal for achieving global connectivity in the next generation 6G infrastructure. Our talk will provide our initial insights into the current LSN performance, with a focus on Starlink, highlighting LSNs' potential in achieving global internet coverage. Our findings reveal notable fluctuations in user experience compared to terrestrial networks, with Starlink subscribers facing variability in throughput, latency, and service disruptions, largely influenced by satellite dynamics and environmental factors like terrain, weather conditions, and temperature. We analyzed Starlink’s existing bent-pipe relay method, especially its efficiency over cross-ocean communications, and considered mobility and portability capabilities. Our research extends to evaluating Starlink in different settings, from urban environments to remote wild locations, discovering the operational and societal challenges of implementing LSNs across diverse landscapes. This talk aims to contribute to the understanding of LSNs' role in future global connectivity solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> A Multifaceted Look at Starlink Network Performance</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Starlink, with its expansive constellation size, is fundamentally transforming global Internet connectivity — positioning itself as a potential "global ISP" that can end global Internet monopolies and close connectivity gaps in remote and disaster-affected areas. Prior investigations into Starlink's network performance have been region-specific and lack a holistic understanding of its global operations. In this talk, I will unveil findings from our first extensive, longitudinal study of Starlink's network performance. Our analysis provides a global overview of Starlink's bandwidth and latency metrics, identifying key factors that influence its service quality. Additionally, I will explore Starlink's dynamic reconfiguration of its satellite links and examine the network's capability to support real-time applications such as video conferencing and cloud gaming.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Megaconstellations in Your Office: Rapid Prototyping for Future Integrated Space and Terrestrial Networks</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We are entering a new era of satellite Internet. Future integrated space and terrestrial networks (ISTN) not only hold new opportunities for pervasive, low-latency Internet services but also involve new challenges caused by satellite dynamics on a global scale. It should be helpful for researchers to run various experiments to explore new problems in ISTNs systematically. In this talk, we introduce StarryNet, a novel experimentation framework that enables researchers to build experimental network environments mimicking satellite dynamics and network behaviors of large-scale ISTNs. StarryNet leverages a real-data-driven, lightweight emulation-aided approach to build a digital twin of physical ISTNs in a laboratory setting. We will show StarryNet’s effectiveness and flexibility to support various space-terrestrial networking experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Technology and Policy Questions We All Must Ask As More LEO Systems Launch</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, Amazon, Telesat, and many others are racing to launch large systems of Low Earth Orbit satellites (LEOs) to provide Internet access. While they can help bridge the digital divide, particularly in rural regions, they could put Internet access into the hands of a few large companies and introduce new security and privacy concerns. What are the opportunities with LEO systems? What are the concerns that regulators, policy makers, technologists, and individuals should be thinking about? How can we use LEO systems to connect more people, while ensuring the Internet remains open, globally connected, secure and trustworthy? The Internet Society, a global nonprofit focused on building a bigger, stronger Internet for everyone, researched LEO systems in 2022. Dan York, leader of the 2022 project, will explain what they found, how secure the systems may or may not be, and most importantly, what questions we all need to be asking as these systems expand.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Enabling the LEO Satellite Edge Ecosystem</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid increase in the number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has created a unique opportunity to provide ubiquitous access to compute resources across the globe. However, for the LEO satellites to become a new edge infrastructure, it is necessary to address the dynamism caused due to the mobility of the satellites (the LEO edge nodes). In this talk, I'll first contrast a LEO edge ecosystem with the current terrestrial edge/cloud ecosystem highlighting the specific gaps in abstractions and orchestration system design. I'll then present the design of a system that can hide the complexities of the dynamic nature of LEO satellites to enable 'LEO Edge as a Service'.</p>

            <p><strong>Talk Title:</strong> Near-realtime Insights from Earth Observation Satellites</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Large constellations of low Earth orbit satellites promise to provide frequent high resolution Earth imagery. Such constellations collect terabytes of data that needs to be shipped to Earth. Getting this data to Earth is challenging and can often take several hours to days before an insight is delivered to the end user. In this talk, I will discuss the networking and compute bottlenecks that cause such large delays. I will also present new distributed networking and compute architectures that can remove such bottlenecks to deliver near-realtime insights from imagery collected using Earth observation satellites.</p>
